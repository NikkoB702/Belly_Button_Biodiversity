# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Project Overview

This project focused on bacterial cultures found inside the human belly button. Our interactive plots show the demographic info, the top-10 bacterial cultures found, the frequency of washing the belly button and finally a scaled bubble chart of the volume of bacteria by count.
